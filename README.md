# CodeAlpha_E-commerce-Store
To explain a major project like this on GitHub, your **README.md** needs to be professional, visual, and clear. A good README acts as the "face" of your project, helping others (and evaluators) understand your logic and how to run the code.

Here is a template you can copy and adapt for your GitHub repository.

## 🗄 Database Schema

The database is structured to handle relational-like data in a NoSQL environment:

| Collection | Key Fields |
| --- | --- |
| **Users** | username, email, password (hashed) |
| **Products** | name, price, description, image, stock |
| **Orders** | userID, items, totalAmount, date |

---

### Tips for your GitHub:

1. **Screenshots:** Take 3-4 screenshots of your website (Home page, Cart, Login) and put them in a folder called `/screenshots`. Reference them in the README.
2. **License:** Add an MIT License so people know they can use your code.
3. **Live Demo:** If you can, deploy it to a platform like **Render** or **Railway** and put the link at the top of the README.

**Would you like me to help you write the "About the Author" or "Challenges Faced" section to make the README even more unique?**
